### Product / Validation

* [ ] Add source maps or at least function/name-section diagnostics.
* [ ] Continue metacircular path: minimal parser or jessie fork suitable for jz.
* [ ] Running wasm files without pulling jz dependency for wrapping nan-boxes: some alternative way to pass data?
* [ ] Date — deterministic spec slices first; local timezone / Intl surface later
  * [ ] Deferred: object `ToPrimitive` coercion order (`coercion-order.js`)
  * [ ] Defer `Date.parse` until Date value objects + UTC stringification exist
  * [ ] Explicitly out of scope: local-time getters/setters, `getTimezoneOffset`, `toString` / `toDateString` / `toTimeString`, locale methods, `toJSON`, `Symbol.toPrimitive`, `toTemporalInstant`, subclassing, realms, descriptors, prototype shape, and function `name`/`length` metadata.
* [ ] Intl
* [ ] test262
* [ ] All AssemblyScript tests.

### Phase 14: Internal Parser (Future)

* [ ] Extract minimal jz parser from subscript features
* [ ] jzify uses jessie, pure jz uses internal parser
* [ ] True metacircular bootstrap

### Build & tooling

* [ ] Metacircularity: subscript parser — needs jz-jessie fork excluding class/async/regex features + refactoring parse.js function-property assignments (~30 lines)
* [ ] Source maps — blocked on watr upstream; can add WASM name section (function names) independently
* [ ] jzify script converting any JZ
* [ ] jzify: auto-import stdlib globals (Math.* → `import math from 'math'`, etc.)
* [ ] jz core: require explicit imports for stdlib (remove auto-import from prepare/compile)
* [ ] align with Crockford practices
* [ ] swappable watr: likely AST will need to be stringified before compile if adapter is provided?

### Validation & quality

* [ ] color-space converter (validates multi profile)
* [ ] digital-filter biquad (validates memory profile)
* [ ] Warn/error on hitting memory limits

### Future

* [ ] metacircularity (jz compiling jz)
* [ ] Component interface (wit)
* [ ] threads/atomics (SharedArrayBuffer, Worker coordination)
* [ ] memory64 (>4GB)
* [ ] relaxed SIMD
* [ ] WebGPU compute shaders

### Offering

* [ ] Clear, fully transparent and understood codebase
* [ ] Completed: docs, readme, code, tests, repl
* [ ] Integrations (floatbeat, color-space, digital-filter)
* [ ] Benchmarks
* [ ] Pick ONE use case, make jz undeniable for it
* [ ] Ship something someone uses
* [ ] Make compile faster than js eval

### Floatbeat playground

* [ ] Syntax highlighter
* [ ] Waveform renderer
* [ ] Database + recipe book
* [ ] Samples collection

### REPL

* [ ] Auto-convert var→let, function→arrow on paste
* [ ] Auto-import implicit globals
* [ ] Show produced WAT
* [ ] Document interop

### EdgeJS PR shape

* [ ] Add an EdgeJS test/harness entry only if it can run in their CI without pulling large optional dependencies or network setup.

### Performance — closing the native-language gap

* [ ] **Stack allocation / scalar-replacement for fixed-size typed arrays** (mat4/biquad/aos — `localArr(f64, 16)` IR, spill on escape). Highest-value remaining perf item: directly speeds up color-space + digital-filter kernels; extends the existing array/object escape-analysis + arena-rewind machinery rather than building new infra.
* [ ] Partial unroll + vector body instead of full unroll (mat4: keep `r` loop, vectorize `k` with `f64x2`) — medium value, mat4-specific
* [ ] json arena/raw-u8 fast path — remaining structural micro-gap (transient `kbuf` in `__jp_obj` is never rewound; per-node `__alloc` calls). Low priority now that the bench sits at ≈1.0× native C; would need parser value-shape redesign for further gains.

### i64-tagged carrier switch (NaN-boxing replacement)

* [ ] Lay out new bit scheme (type:8 / aux:24 / offset:32) — still `type:4 @bit47, aux:15 @bit32`. Risky carrier refactor; only payoff is headroom (more schemaId bits, more elem tags). Deferred — no user value today.
* [ ] Audit and remove obsolete f64-NaN-payload literals from `module/*` (only relevant once bit scheme changes)
* [ ] Reclaim bits: lift schemaId from 15→24 bits, more elem-type tags (depends on bit scheme)

### Size / watr gap

* [ ] Source/runtime array-view optimization for local queue-style arrays (`normalize()`) — needs source refactor or escape-analysis extension
* [ ] Dynamic object/property-shape specialization for watr context — partial: constant `.prop`/`?.prop` keys now prehash (`__dyn_get_t` is a thin wrapper over `__dyn_get_t_h(obj,key,type,h)`; sites pass compile-time `strHashLiteral(prop)` → no `__str_hash` per access), `__set_len` calls inlined, `__typed_idx` ARRAY fast path, additive hash-probe walks. Remaining static narrowing only (schema-slot access, `__is_str_key` elision). N-way prop caches & static-segment off-16 props slots analyzed as net-negative — bytes for unmeasurable gain; watr's hot dyn-prop receivers (`ctx`, AST nodes) are heap arrays that already use off-16 header slots.

### watr — latent trampoline arity bug

* [ ] Uniform closure-table signature is sized by `ctx.closure.width` (max *call-site* arity), but boundary trampolines for first-class function values reference `$__a${i}` up to the *function's* arity. A function with more params than `width` (e.g. `encode.f32(input, value, idx)`, arity 3, in a program whose closure calls never pass 3 args) emits `(local.get $__a2)` against a 2-param trampoline → `Unknown local $__a2`. Fix: `width = max(callSiteArities, tableResidentFnArities)`. Not triggered by the watr suite (full build's width is already ≥3).


## Ideas

* [ ] webpack, esbuild, unplugin etc – extract and compile fast pieces with jz
* [ ] jz as a compilation target — not just for humans writing JS, but for DSLs that want WASM output. If you add a simple IR or intermediate format, other tools could emit jz-compatible code and get WASM for free.
* [ ] The template tag as a build tool — jz\code`` in a Node script replaces a build step. No webpack, no esbuild, no plugin. This is uniquely elegant and under-marketed.

### Size — closing the AS gap

* [x] Rejected two adjacent follow-ups after benchmarking (non-string fallback, string-literal equality helper)

* [x] Re-observe schema slots after E2 valResult
* [x] Plain array growth does not move dynamic prop side-tables

* [x] Watr inliner soundness fix (upstream)
* [x] AST helper consolidation
* [x] Fixpoint runner consolidation
* [x] `.charCodeAt(i)` returns i32 directly — tokenizer 0.14 → 0.07ms (2×)

* [x] watr regression — `v128.const i64x2` lowering fix (`6186dcd`)

### Dynamic-property machinery in jz-compiled watr

* [x] `__set_len` calls inlined to direct header `i32.store`
* [x] `__typed_idx` ARRAY fast path (skip type re-dispatch on known-ARRAY receivers)
* [x] Generic hash-probe loop tightening — additive slot walk, drop per-iter `i32.mul` (`c1ce0a0`)
* [x] Additive probe walk in `__dyn_get_t_h` props loop (`a8b7976`, +12 B)
* [x] Prehash constant `.prop` / `?.prop` keys — `__dyn_get_t` is a thin wrapper over `__dyn_get_t_h(obj,key,type,h)`; new `__dyn_get_expr_t_h`; sites pass compile-time `strHashLiteral(prop)` → no `__str_hash` per access (`1790cb7`, +0.27% wasm, checksum stable). Also fixed latent `needsSchemaTbl` gap (now keys on `__dyn_get_t_h` / `__dyn_get_expr_t_h`).
* [x] Rejected: N-way global dyn-get cache — 1-way already hits the dominant "same object, many keys" pattern (`INSTR[op]`); 4-way = ~9 globals + ~250 B for unmeasurable gain
* [x] Rejected: static-segment off-16 props slot for object/array literals — watr's hot dyn-prop receivers (`ctx`, AST nodes) are heap arrays that already use off-16 header slots; relaxing the `off >= __heap_start` guard is high-risk for no return

### JSON optimizations

* [x] JSON benchmark made honest (no exact-shape specialization)
* [x] `\uXXXX` escape decoding in `__jp` string scanner

### Type system / codegen architecture

* [x] Unified Type record (`ValueRep`) — collapsed ptrKind/ptrAux/globals/val/schemaId into `repByLocal`/`repByGlobal`
* [x] `intCertain` forward-prop lattice + codegen rules (`toNumF64` skip, `Math.floor/ceil/trunc/round` elide)
* [x] Per-emitter short-circuit migration for `__to_num`, unary `+`, `isNaN`/`isFinite`, `Number()`, `Math.*`
* [x] Parallel-map dedup, dead helpers removed (-697 lines compile.js, +568 analyze.js)
* [x] Unboxed-by-default ABI inversion — closed as architecture backlog
* [x] Per-stage base hoisting + `offset=` fusion
* [x] General `offset=` immediate fusion
* [x] Constant-arg propagation (without unroll)
* [x] Rejected: intConst-driven i32 loop narrowing for biquad — V8 inliner regression
* [x] Small-trip-count loop unroll on top of intConst
* [x] Tail call optimization
